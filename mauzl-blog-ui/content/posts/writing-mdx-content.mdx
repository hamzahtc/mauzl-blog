# Writing MDX Content

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. This means you can:

- Import and use React components directly in your markdown
- Use JSX syntax and expressions
- Apply layout and styling to your markdown content

## Basic Syntax

MDX supports all the standard markdown syntax, plus the ability to use JSX:

```mdx
# Hello, world!

This is **bold** and this is *italic*.

<Button>Click me</Button>
```

## Using Components

You can import and use React components in your MDX files:

```mdx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

# My MDX Page

Click the button below:

<Button>Click me</Button>
```

## Frontmatter

MDX files can include frontmatter, which is a YAML-like key-value pairing at the top of the file:

```mdx
---
title: My Page
description: This is my page description
---

# {frontmatter.title}

{frontmatter.description}
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful way to write content for your Next.js application. It combines the simplicity of markdown with the power of React components.
